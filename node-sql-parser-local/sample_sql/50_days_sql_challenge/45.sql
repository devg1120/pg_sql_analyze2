You have two tables: Orders and Customers.

 - Orders Table Columns: 
Order_id, Customer_id, Order_Date, Amount

- Customers Table Columns: 
Customer_id, Customer_Name, Join_Date
 
Write an SQL query to calculate the total 
order amount for each customer who joined 
in the current year. 

The output should contain Customer_Name and 
the total amount.

*/
-- join both table based on cx id
-- filter the cx records for current_year 
-- based on eacx cx id sum the amount
-- group by cx id


SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM orders;


SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(o.amount)
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
customers as c
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id    
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM c.join_date) = 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP by 1;
























-- SELECT *, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM join_date) FROM Customers

-- SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);





SELECT 
    -- c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_amt
FROM orders as o

customers as c
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

WHERE c.join_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'      
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name;











-- Your Task
-- Write a SQL query to return each and and total orders for current year
-- return month_number, total orders
